# Next Word Prediction

Welcome to the Next Word Prediction project! This project is focused on building a system that predicts the next word in a given sequence of text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and advanced neural network models.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Predict the next word in a sentence or sequence of text.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models
  - Sequence modeling

## Project Highlights

1. **LSTM and GRU Models:**
   - Implemented LSTM and GRU models to capture dependencies and patterns in sequential data.
   - Demonstrated proficiency in sequence modeling techniques.

2. **NLP Techniques:**
   - Leveraged Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis.
   - Explored methods for text preprocessing and feature extraction.

3. **Advanced Neural Networks:**
   - Utilized advanced neural network architectures to improve prediction accuracy.
   - Explored the use of deep learning for language modeling.
